    "# **Predict Cancer Mortality Rates in US Counties**\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided dataset comprises data collected from multiple counties in the US. The regression task for this assessment is to predict cancer mortality rates in \"unseen\" US counties, given some training data. The training data ('Training_data.csv') comprises various features/predictors related to socio-economic characteristics, amongst other types of information for specific counties in the country. The corresponding target variables for the training set are provided in a separate CSV file ('Training_data_targets.csv'). Use the notebooks provided for lab sessions throughout this module to provide solutions to the exercises listed below. Throughout all exercises, text describing your code and answering any questions included in the exercise descriptions should be provided as part of your submitted solution. (Total Marks for this Assessment is 40)\n",

    "Note - We also provide an example test data set ('Test_data_example.csv' and 'Test_data_example_targets.csv'). This is just an example of the final test set (which will not be provided to you) that will be used to evaluate your solutions when your submitted solutions are being marked. Part of this assessment requires you to write an inference script that evaluates the regression models you have trained on the final test data set such that we are able to run the inference script ourselves on the test data (you can use the example test data to verify that it works prior to submission).\n",

    "Read in the training data and targets files. The training data comprises features/predictors while the targets file comprises the targets (i.e. cancer mortality rates in US counties) you need to train models to predict. Plot histograms of all features to visualise their distributions and identify outliers. Do you notice any unusual values for any of the features? If so comment on these in the text accompanying your code. Compute correlations of all features with the target variable (across the data set) and sort them according the strength of correlations. Which are the top five features with strongest correlations to the targets? Plot these correlations using the scatter matrix plotting function available in pandas and comment on at least two sets of features that show visible correlations to each other. (5 marks)"
